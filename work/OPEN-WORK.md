# OPEN-WORK — what is still open

**This file is the LIST, plus the legend below.** Everything else — what the
queue is, an item's lifecycle, the shape of a row, ball precedence, ordering,
how the inbox works, and what every session owes — is stated once in
**[SR-WORK-OPEN-QUEUE](../records/0051_WORK-open-queue.md)** and is not repeated
here. Read that record before changing anything below it.

**A ball on every row, always one:** 🔴 blocked on the decider, directly or through another item · 🟣 gated on a named date, directly or through another item · 🟡 waiting on another item · 🟢 no blockers.
**Optional, after the ball:** 🧨 broken or getting worse · 🔺 do first (the decider only). Full legend: [SR-WORK-OPEN-QUEUE](../records/0051_WORK-open-queue.md) rules 20–34.

## Blocked on the decider

| what the decider decides | filed | age |
|---|---|---|

*Empty since 2026-10-19 — next gate: W-30 and W-48, the decider's hands-on runs (testing), and a trusted publisher on `@sheetpane/tables`, `review` and `compare` before the next release.*

## Open items

### build

### testing

- 🟢 **W-30** `arpit` · Save one tiny sheet from Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice and Numbers; an agent then tests `@sheetpane/import` on them (split from W-13); also the static HTML of W-67 opened in mail clients (DoD 10). Filed by Arpit (Cowork). [detail](open/W-30-real-app-fixtures.md)

- 🟢 **W-48** `arpit` · Try the skills package in Claude Code, Kiro and Codex: install from the tarballs into a scratch host, one real prompt each, note the result (split from W-35 DoD 8). Filed by Arpit (Cowork). [detail](open/W-48-try-skills-in-each-tool.md)
